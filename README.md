### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Salma, a 24-year-old Junior Data Scientist passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. Currently, I'm working at Nexialog Consulting, focusing on the explainability of machine learning models. Alongside my professional experience, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science and Financial Modeling at Paris 1 PanthÃ©on-Sorbonne University.

ðŸŒ± My main interests lie in predictive modeling, data pipeline design, and applying machine learning techniques to tackle real-world challenges. Iâ€™m driven by a desire to create robust, scalable solutions that bridge the gap between data and decision-making.
